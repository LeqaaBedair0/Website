  <h1 id="hwelcome"> Welcome to Latto Café </h1>
  <h2>Our History</h2>
  <p id="pwelcome"> Latto Café was founded in the heart of Rome in 1950 by Giovanni Latto, a passionate coffee enthusiast with a dream
    of creating a cozy haven for coffee lovers. Giovanni's vision was to blend traditional Italian coffee culture with a
    warm, inviting atmosphere where friends and family could gather. Over the decades, Latto Café became renowned for
    its artisanal espresso, freshly baked pastries, and charming ambiance. Today, Latto Café continues to uphold
    Giovanni's legacy, serving as a beloved spot for locals and tourists alike to enjoy a taste of authentic Italian
    hospitality. </p>
